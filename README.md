## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge was interesting to get familiar with some CSS properties and proportional size units, like ``em``, ``rem``, ``vh`` and ``vw``. It also helped me to remember some basics about **flexbox** layout.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Guide which helped me to center the main card with flexbox.
- [Modern CSS Units](https://desenvolvimentoparaweb.com/css/unidades-css-rem-vh-vw-vmin-vmax-ex-ch/) - Article (in portuguese) that helped me understand modern CSS size units.
